# G52OSC Operating Systems and Concurrency (Group 25)
## Project Description

In this coursework, we have implemented scheduler programs with different scheduling algorithms in C language including First Come First Serve, Round Robin and Multi-Level Feedback Queue. All three scheduler programs were being tested with 3 different workloads that came along with arrival time and burst time of the processes as input. The scheduler programs shall display the average turnaround time and average waiting time of the current workload.

## Requirements

Any IDE software that supports compiling and editing of C language (e.g. CodeBlocks, VSCode).

## How to Run
1. Open the desired .c file (named according to the scheduling algorithms) in the preferred IDE for C language.
2. If you choose to use VSCode, please consider downloading and using the extensions, C/C++ for Visual Studio Code and Code Runner.
3. Build and run the program.
4. Input the number of processes, the arrival time and burst time of each processes.
5. Input the time quantum (for Round Robin).
6. The program will display the average turnaround time, average waiting time and throughput of the entered processes.
7. If the output result obtained are garbage values, please try with an online compiler such as [Replit](https://replit.com/new/c)
